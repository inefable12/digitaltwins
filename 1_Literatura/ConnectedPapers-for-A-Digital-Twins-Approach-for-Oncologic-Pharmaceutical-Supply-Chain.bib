abstract = {Oncological treatments are especially challenging due to the high degree of therapy personalisation that calls for the on-demand preparation of drugs and accurate timing in the distribution and delivery process. The suitability of the patient’s condition to carry on with the ongoing therapy is monitored periodically and bootstraps the whole preparation of a new iteration of the treatment. This makes pharmaceutical supply chain management very difficult to optimise since it needs to be responsive to sudden change while efficient in terms of costs and usage of resources. In this paper, we identify the main challenges of the domain drawing from the available related works and the experience maturated in collaboration with a public cancer care and research institute. We then propose how Digital Twins could be used as a way to engineer a system to support the accurate tracking of such a complex reality to monitor effectiveness and efficiency, as well as collect data and support decision-making using predictions and simulations to optimise the overall process.},

abstract = {Background The concept of digital twins has great potential for transforming the existing health care system by making it more personalized. As a convergence of health care, artificial intelligence, and information and communication technologies, personalized health care services that are developed under the concept of digital twins raise a myriad of ethical issues. Although some of the ethical issues are known to researchers working on digital health and personalized medicine, currently, there is no comprehensive review that maps the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. Objective This study aims to fill the research gap by identifying the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. We first propose a working definition for digital twins for personalized health care services to facilitate future discussions on the ethical issues related to these emerging digital health services. We then develop a process-oriented ethical map to identify the major ethical risks in each of the different data processing phases. Methods We resorted to the literature on eHealth, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering to identify potential issues and developed a process-oriented ethical map to structure the inquiry in a more systematic way. The ethical map allows us to see how each of the major ethical concerns emerges during the process of transforming raw data into valuable information. Developers of a digital twin for personalized health care service may use this map to identify ethical risks during the development stage in a more systematic way and can proactively address them. Results This paper provides a working definition of digital twins for personalized health care services by identifying 3 features that distinguish the new application from other eHealth services. On the basis of the working definition, this paper further layouts 10 major operational problems and the corresponding ethical risks. Conclusions It is challenging to address all the major ethical risks that a digital twin for a personalized health care service might encounter proactively without a conceptual map at hand. The process-oriented ethical map we propose here can assist the developers of digital twins for personalized health care services in analyzing ethical risks in a more systematic manner.},

abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) play a vital role in revolutionising the healthcare industry, leading to more personalised, intelligent, and proactive healthcare. With the evolution of personalised healthcare, there is a significant need to represent a virtual replica for individuals to provide the right type of care in the right way and at the right time. Therefore, in this paper, we surveyed the concept of a personal digital twin (PDT) as an enhanced version of the DT with actionable insight capabilities. In particular, PDT can bring value to patients by enabling more accurate decision making and proper treatment selection and optimisation. Then, we explored the progression of PDT as a revolutionary technology in healthcare research and industry. However, although several research works have been performed for smart healthcare using DT, PDT is still at an early stage. Consequently, we believe that this work can be a step towards smart personalised healthcare industry by guiding the design of industrial personalised healthcare systems. Accordingly, we introduced a reference framework that empowers smart personalised healthcare using PDTs by bringing together existing advanced technologies (i.e., DT, blockchain, and AI). Then, we described some selected use cases, including the mitigation of COVID-19 contagion, COVID-19 survivor follow-up care, personalised COVID-19 medicine, personalised osteoporosis prevention, personalised cancer survivor follow-up care, and personalised nutrition. Finally, we identified further challenges to pave the PDT paradigm toward the smart personalised healthcare industry.},

abstract = {The human digital twin (HDT) is a new paradigm that possesses the ability to revolutionize the current healthcare systems. With HDT, ensuring an efficient connectivity scheme between each human-virtual twin pair remains a significant problem. As the concept of HDT is new, conventional connectivity schemes cannot meet the unique requirements of HDT in terms of reliability, security and privacy. This paper thus proposes an edge-assisted connectivity scheme for HDT and adopts an integrated blockchain and federated learning techniques to ensure security and privacy. To minimize long-term average connectivity cost, we formulated the connectivity problem as a Markov decision process and adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn the optimal connectivity policy in terms of connectivity cost. The obtained results were then compared with the conventional deep Q-network-based solution. The results show that the proposed DDPG-based connectivity solution is feasible to perform the connectivity process better by optimally allocating system resources, thus reducing the overall connectivity cost, while ensuring data security and privacy.},

In this article, we reviewed the literature about these technologies and their integrations, identifying the most critical requirements for clinical platforms. These latter have been used to design CONNECTED (COmpreheNsive and staNdardized hEalth-Care plaTforms to collEct and harmonize clinical Data), a conceptual framework aimed at defining guidelines to overcome the crucial issues related to the development of healthcare applications. It is structured in a multi-layer shape, in which heterogeneous data sources are first integrated, then standardized, and finally used to realize general-purpose DTs of patients backed by PKGs and accessible through dedicated APIs. These DTs will be the foundation on which smart applications can be built.},

This digital twin opens completely new and until now unthinkable possibilities, not only in the field of monitoring and prevention, moreover it is the key to personalized medicine. However, unlike other domains, the healthcare sector lacks a structured approach to exploit this paradigm.

abstract = {Background: Digital Twins (DTs), virtual copies of physical entities, are a promising tool to help manage and predict outbreaks of Covid-19. By providing a detailed model of each patient, DTs can be used to determine what method of care will be most effective for that individual. The improvement in patient experience and care delivery will help to reduce demand on healthcare services and to improve hospital management. Objectives: The aim of this study is to address 2 research questions: (1) How effective are DTs in predicting and managing infectious diseases such as Covid-19? and (2) What are the prospects and challenges associated with the use of DTs in healthcare? Methods: The review was structured according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. Titles and abstracts of references in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar were searched using selected keywords (relating to digital twins, healthcare and Covid-19). The papers were screened in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria so that all papers published in English relating to the use of digital twins in healthcare were included. A narrative synthesis was used to analyse the included papers. Results: Eighteen papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. None of the included papers examined the use of DTs in the context of Covid-19, or infectious disease outbreaks in general. Academic research about the applications, opportunities and challenges of DT technology in healthcare in general was found to be in early stages. Conclusions: The review identifies a need for further research into the use of DTs in healthcare, particularly in the context of infectious disease outbreaks. Based on frameworks identified during the review, this paper presents a preliminary conceptual framework for the use of DTs for hospital management during the Covid-19 outbreak to address this research gap.},

abstract = {IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.},

Its implementation is expected to be similar to digital twins proposed in other application areas such as manufacturing and aviation by consisting of three key dimensions: the physical entity, virtual model, and connection that characterizes the physical-virtual interactions. The known complexity of human body structure because of the constant molecular and physiological changes, however, means extracting precise medical data as well as modeling of HDT is very difficult. Hence, HDT is much more complex than its counterparts and its implementation methods remain unclear, which deserves further investigation. This article thus presents the architectural framework and key design requirements of HDT and then discusses the key technologies and technical challenges to suggest future directions. We believe that this article will open up new research opportunities and motivate new research efforts towards the development of HDT for PHS.},

The Digital Twin (DT) technology, based on the virtualization of physical assets/processes and on a bidirectional communication between the digital and physical space for data exchange, is considered a game changer in modern health systems. Digital Twin applications in healthcare are various, ranging from virtualization of hospitals' physical spaces/organizational processes to individuals' physiological/genetic/lifestyle characteristics replication, and include the modeling of public health-related processes for monitoring, optimization and planning purposes.

Despite its importance, this characteristic has not been yet fully investigated, and its impact on applications' design is underestimated. In this paper, we define the concept of “Degree of Entanglement” (DoE), which provides an operational model for assessing the strength of the entanglement between a DT and its physical counterpart. We also propose an interoperable representation of DoE within the Web of Things (WoT) framework, which enables DT-driven applications to dynamically adapt to changes in the physical environment. We evaluate our proposal using two realistic use cases, demonstrating the practical utility of DoE in supporting, for instance, context-awareness decisions and adaptiveness.},

Furthermore, the functionalities of the digital twin in different life stages are summarized in the context of a digital twin model in healthcare. Following the Internet of Things as a service concept and digital twining as a service model supporting Industry 4.0, we propose a paradigm of digital twinning everything as a healthcare service, and different groups of physical entities are also clarified for clear reference of digital twin architecture in healthcare.

 UNSTRUCTURED
 With the development of the world economy and improvements in living standards, people are paying more attention to their healthcare. As simulation is playing an increasingly important role in the field of medicine, providing the individual patient with a customised diagnosis and treatment is envisage as part of future precision medicine. Such customisation will become possible through the emergence of digital twin (DT) technology. As an engineering concept that reflects the true mirror image of a physical entity, the DT is increasingly being used in the field of precision health and personalised medicine. This review summarises the progress of prominent research on DT technology in the medical field and forecasts potential applications and future opportunities and discusses several challenges remaining in digital healthcare. The author hopes that the review encourages additional efforts towards the development and acceptance of DT techniques.

abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical entity, with dynamic, bi-directional links between the physical entity and its corresponding twin in the digital domain. Digital twins are increasingly used today in different industry sectors. Applied to medicine and public health, digital twin technology can drive a much-needed radical transformation of traditional electronic health/medical records (focusing on individuals) and their aggregates (covering populations) to make them ready for a new era of precision (and accuracy) medicine and public health. Digital twins enable learning and discovering new knowledge, new hypothesis generation and testing, and in silico experiments and comparisons. They are poised to play a key role in formulating highly personalised treatments and interventions in the future. This paper provides an overview of the technology’s history and main concepts. A number of application examples of digital twins for personalised medicine, public health, and smart healthy cities are presented, followed by a brief discussion of the key technical and other challenges involved in such applications, including ethical issues that arise when digital twins are applied to model humans.},

abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) are used in many different industries (e.g., manufacturing, construction, automotive, and aerospace), and there is an initial trend of applications in healthcare, mainly focusing on precision medicine. If their potential is fully unfolded, DTs will facilitate the as-yet-unrealized potential of connected care and alter the way lifestyle, health, wellness, and chronic disease will be managed in the future. To date, however, due to technical, regulatory and ethical roadblocks, there is no consensus as to what extent DTs in healthcare can introduce revolutionary applications in the next decade. In this review, we present the current applications of DTs covering multiple areas of healthcare (precision medicine, clinical trial design, and hospital operations) to identify the opportunities and the barriers that foster or hinder their larger and faster diffusion. Finally, we discuss the current findings, opportunities and barriers, and provide recommendations to facilitate the continuous development of DTs application in healthcare.},

abstract = {In recent years, digital twins have been pervading different application domains—from manufacturing to healthcare—as an approach for virtualising different kinds of physical entities (things, products, machines). The dominant view developed in the literature so far is about the virtualisation of individual physical assets in a closed-system perspective. In this article, we introduce and explore a broader perspective that we call Web of Digital Twins (WoDT), in which the digital twin paradigm is exploited for the pervasive softwarisation of possibly large-scale interrelated physical realities. A WoDT can be conceived as an open, distributed and dynamic ecosystem of connected digital twins, functioning as an interoperable service-oriented layer for applications running on top, especially smart applications and multiagent systems. The article introduces an abstract model and architecture aimed to capture key aspects of the idea not bound to any specific application domains or implementing technologies and discusses their adoption in engineering real-world systems. To this purpose, two concrete case studies are considered, in the context of healthcare and smart mobility. Finally, the article includes a discussion of a selected set of research directions.},

abstract = {Healthcare systems are complex systems that need effective and efficient operations, optimizations, management, and control to offer reliable, high-quality, and cost-effective healthcare services. There are different approaches to improve the management of healthcare systems including utilizing the healthcare systems engineering principles. Healthcare systems engineering views a healthcare organization as a system and applies the engineering analysis and design principles to improve different aspects of healthcare services provided in that system. While this approach can provide many advantages for healthcare organizations, there are also many challenges hindering the ability of healthcare systems engineers from effectively accomplishing their mission. The initiation of the digital twin technology formed several potential methods for various industrial sectors to enhance their operations. Accordingly, they can help improve productivity, cost-effectiveness, reliability, quality, and flexibility. This paper studies how digital twins can be utilized for improving healthcare systems engineering processes and outcomes to enhance different aspects of healthcare systems. The paper discusses some of the challenges of healthcare systems engineering and how these challenges can be relaxed by utilizing digital twins. The paper also develops a conceptual framework to utilize digital twins for improving healthcare systems engineering processes and outcomes and discusses the prospects of such utilization on achieving the goals of healthcare systems engineering. In addition, the paper provides some discussions on the impact of this utilization and the future research and development projections of the employment of digital twins for healthcare systems engineering.},

Because of these current research gaps, the proper way of acquiring the structured data and managing them in a secure way is very important. In this article, we present a mathematical data model to accumulate the patient relevant data in a structured and predefined way with proper delineation. Additionally, the provided data model is described in harmony with real life contexts. Then, we have used the patient centric mathematical data model to formally define the semantic and scope of our proposed Healthcare Digital Twin (HDT) system based on Blockchain. Accordingly, the proposed system is described with all the key components as well as with detailed protocol flows and an analysis of its different aspects.

This article proposes the application of this concept to the healthcare domain to provide enhanced clinical decision support and enable more patient‐centric, and simultaneously more precise and individualized care to ensue. Digital twins combined with advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to facilitate the integration and processing of vast amounts of heterogeneous data stemming from diversified sources. Hence, in healthcare this can provide enhanced diagnosis and treatment decision support. In applying digital twins in combination with AI to complex healthcare contexts to assist clinical decision making, it is also likely that a key current challenge in healthcare; namely, providing better quality care which is of high value and can lead to better clinical outcomes and a higher level of patient satisfaction, can ensue. In this focus article, we address this proposition by focusing on the case study of cancer care and present our conceptualization of a digital twin model combined with AI to address key, current limitations in endometrial cancer treatment. We highlight the role of AI techniques in developing digital twins for cancer care and simultaneously identify key barriers and facilitators of this process from both a healthcare and technology perspective.},

abstract = {In SDN-based networks, contextual understanding of network behaviour and safe execution of operational decisions are important as part of the network management process. Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a promising concept which creates a virtual twin of a live SDN-based network to monitor the network from different angles with various granularities and enables it to verify an operational change without disturbing the live one. However, modelling the arbitrary decisions by an SDN Controller to form a DTN and managing the contextual information in a DTN are challenging tasks in various aspects. This paper proposes a data representation based DTN architecture integrating Knowledge Graph (KG) for data modelling and storage and Template as the context description approach. The combination of KG and Template can make the DTN management scalable with the flexibility of defining the contextual information with the relationships between network entities. It also enables efficient querying of the data storage and provides the reusability of functions and data storage for the DTN applications development. The proposed DTN architecture was implemented using an ONOS-based SDN Controller and Neo4j-based KG with built-in DTN applications for practical use. The PoC implementation exhibited short query response time and high query throughput in reading from and updating a KG, though the initial creation of a KG incurs a considerable delay which increases with its size.},
